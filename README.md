## Ping TimeOut

Do you have a freely pingable role that everyone can ping that is regally being spammed?

Then this bot is for you!

With this bot you can add a timer to specific roles so they can only be pinged every X amount of time.

---
#### Setup
1. First check with _/timeout-check_ to which roles you can add a timer. It also shows what roles already have a timer connected.
2. Add your first timer to a role with _/timeout-role add [role] [duration] [magnitude]_. Example command _/timeout-role add @mod 1 hour_. This makes it so that normal users can only ping the @mod role every hour.
3. Let a normal user ping the role and see if they can ping it again directly after or if they need to wait.

---
#### Notes/Good to know
- When you add the bot/add a timer/edit a timer the bot checks if the @everyone role can mention @everyone. If that is the case the bot will set that permission to false. This is to make sure that you don't get confused why people can still ping certain roles when they shouldn't be pingable. (I recommend never the mention @everyone permission on non-staff roles!)
